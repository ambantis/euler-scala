 * Sum square difference

 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2^ = 3025

 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
 * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares
 * of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
