 * Quadratic primes
 *
 * Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula
 *           n**2 + n + 41
 *
 * It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
 * values n = 40, 40**2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and
 * certainly when n = 4, 41**2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
 *
 * Using computers, the incredible formula n**2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered,
 * which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The
 * product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126,479.
 *
 * Considering the quadratics of the form:
 *           n**2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
 *           where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
 *           e.g., |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4
 *
 * Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic equation
 * that produces the maximum number of primes for the consecutive values of n,
